## Challenge:  The Opiate Crisis
The opiate crisis is a national problem— but one that has hit Connecticut particularly hard.  The state, however, has a number of resources that are designed to help individuals and families that are struggling with addiction.

Your team is charged with creating an application that provides useful information to families and addicts in an integrated form.  For example, an application might provide an integrated geolocation based display of treatment resources available— or perhaps directions to the nearest Pharmacy equipped to distribute Naloxone.  The specific content you choose to display in your app, and the manner in which you display the content to the user is up to you and your team.

Using data from the Connecticut Open Data initiative ( http://data.ct.gov ) you should create an app that both provides useful data and directs families to appropriate resources:


What types of conclusions can be drawn from an analysis of the data?  For example, is there a strong correlation between areas where accidental overdose deaths occur and treatment resources?  Does an analysis of the data provide any type of indication of areas that are under-resourced?   Does the data lead you to conclude that any regions of Connecticut are handling the crisis better than others?


What information would be helpful for families and addicts who seek treatment?  What type of emergency information could the app provide that might be helpful in a crisis?  Can the app match families and addicts with treatment providers in a meaningful way?

You will find numerous useful resources in the Health and Human Services Category of the Connecticut Data site located at https://data.ct.gov/browse?category=Health+and+Human+Services.  By no means is your team obligated to limit yourselves to data from that category.  All data used must be accessed via REST API or direct dataset download.  No embeds from the CT.gov site will be permitted to be displayed in your project.
